  summary: 'Provides functions to fit the normal means problem using Empirical Bayes. The goal
    is for these functions to be simple, fast and stable. Currently two models are implemented:
    the point-normal and point-laplace priors. The point-normal is considerably faster.
    See functions ebnm_point_normal, ebnm_point_laplace.'
